# Button-Football

The carnival of the football game has started again. There are two teams in the game. They represent the players with buttons. Each team can choose the color and style of their buttons, and see which team can shoot the most ball into the opponent's goal within two minutes, so that it can get high score. Everybody look forward to it! Is the biggest winner you?
